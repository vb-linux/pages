# Welcome to **vb**-**linux** pages
      We used arch BTW :D
Why vb-linux? Because I think that [void linux](https://voidlinux.org/) is best linux out there.

With one exception. For linux or computer begginers isn't easy at all.

### What about Project Trident ?

[Project Trident](https://project-trident.org) heading to the end.

Looks like nothing based on void anywhere...

I admire hard work of void developers and contributors

A lot of distribution based on debian or arch..

## And here I came...

For me is void first linux distribuion which is easy to understand and manage.

Together with enough recent versions of packages and stability.

so

# **vb-linux**
