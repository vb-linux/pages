Why vb linux? Because I think that [void linux](https://voidlinux.org/) is best linux out there.

With one exception. For linux or computer begginers isn't easy at all.

### What about Project Trident ?

[Project Trident](https://project-trident.org) heading to the end.

Looks like nothing based on void anywhere...

I admire hard work of void developers and contributors

A lot of distribution based on debian or arch..

Why void linux hadn't ?

## And here I came...

For me is void first linux distribuion which is easy to understand and manage, together with enough recent versions of packages and stability.

so

I am starting community project and hoped that will survive.

# Goal

Build start point, full-featured desktop operation system for anyone.

## Interested ?

Soon in your computers...

:D

Stay in touch...
