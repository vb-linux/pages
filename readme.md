# Welcome to **vb**-**linux** temporary web
      We used arch BTW :D

 [Void linux](https://voidlinux.org/) is best linux distribution out there.

 With one exception. Not that easy for linux or computer begginers.
 
 (like could be)

### What about Project Trident ?

[Project Trident](https://project-trident.org) sadly heading to the end.

Looks like nothing based on void anywhere ...

**I admire hard work of void developers and contributors**

A lot of distribution based on debian or arch ...

## And here I came ...

Void is first linux distribution which is still easy to understand and manage.

Together with enough recent versions of packages and stability.

So let's endorse [void](https://voidlinux.org/) a bit ...

# **vb-linux/GNU**

I am starting community project ...

# Goal

- build start point.
- you can call it `void begginer friendly overlay`
- full-featured desktop operation system for anyone.

# How ?

You didn't know void yet don't you?

easy

- provide installation media
- provide this website
- provide `community repository` called simply [VUR](https://github.com/vb-linux/VUR)
- thanks to [unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) and [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) principle

# Why ?

- because a lot of usefull apps can't be merged into void repos.
- (for good reasons)
- help promote excellent void linux
- help promote privacy, security and federation
- help promote GNU/linux and FOSS in general
- help create FOSS world bigger
- because we can
- learn more
- have fun

## Interested ?

Soon in your computers ...

 BTW :D

Stay in touch ...
